\title{Eyefit function of geoR with higher range for phi and sigma}
\usage{
eyefit.large(vario, max.phi = 2, max.sigma = 2, silent = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{vario}{An empirical variogram object as returned by the function
  \code{\link[geoR]{variog}}.  }

\item{max.phi}{Numeric as multiplied by max(vario$u). Default to 2.}

\item{max.sigma}{Numeric as multiplied by max(vario$v). Default to 2.}

\item{silent}{logical indicating wheather or not the fitted variogram
    must be returned.  }
